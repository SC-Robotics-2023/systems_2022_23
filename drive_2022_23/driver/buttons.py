# Description:
#   I don't know what this does, but it's important so don't touch it
#       jk you can touch it, but don't break it
#   Though I don't even know how you would break it, since its just printing stuff
#       and half of it does nothing
#   This is useful if you want to make functional calls from your controller
#       like rumble, or changing the color of the light bar, or with buttons pressed
#   We didn't ended up using this bc we only need 6 inputs, but it's here if you want 
#       to use it
